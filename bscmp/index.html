		<h2>My journey</h2>
		<p>Computers were my passion since I was a child. I&rsquo;ve started with computer games and moved to learning basics of programming slightly after. That&rsquo;s why I spent all my free time with my best friend, creating websites and getting better with my PHP skills. I&rsquo;ve also worked part-time in local computer shop, building gaming PC&rsquo;s and killing it in WoW.</p>

		<p>After high school In the begining I started to make web pages just for fun, but it turned out to be a business for me later.
			I wanted to work for myself and go on my own path, so I  was freelancing and done some small websites, e-commerce sites and information systems. 
Also, I went to study at Unicorn College, 3yrs Bc. degree plan focused on ICT Management.</p>
 
		<p>In 2011 I&rsquo;ve joined a small team of around 30 ppl. in Socialbakers - a social media analytics startup. I didn&rsquo;t finish the last year at the college as I was fully hooked up with the new challenge at Socialbakers, where I felt that I am learning much more new things.
During the almost 6 years there I went through several official roles - Developer, Scrum Master and Product Owner.  
But actually It has always been about wearing more hats at once. And honestly? I loved it. Because there were many opportunities how to create value for customers or the company itself, no matter what your job title was.</p>

		<p>Yet, so many things changed lately at Socialbakers. I realized that it&rsquo;s no longer the same company I used to love and be so dedicated to. 
I&rsquo;ve always been driven by 2 simple rules - do what you love and have freedom doing that. And I wasn&rsquo;t sure that both are valid anymore.</p>

		<p>Which is why I&rsquo;ve decided to restart my life. I left Socialbakers in Dec 2016 and took a few months downtime to figure out what will be my next challenge.</p>

		<p>Then, by the end of the year, I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/811332657338576896" target="_blank">Jason&rsquo;s tweet</a>. Truly, my dream has always been working for a company like Basecamp. So I was thinking a lot and realized that this could be the biggest opportunity in my life. And since I truly believe we could be a great team, I&rsquo;ve decided to go all in.</p>

		<h2>So&hellip; Why me?</h2>
		
		<p>I am determined, reliable and hard working. Well, about the hard work, I&rsquo;ve realized that the challenge is to always think how to work smarter, not just harder.</p>

		<p>Most of the projects I have been working on as developer were <abbr>PHP</abbr> (LAMP) based. Although I&rsquo;ve met <abbr>Ruby on Rails</abbr> and <abbr>C#</abbr> during my studies at the college; then with <abbr>JS</abbr> mostly at Socialbakers and also with <abbr>Swift</abbr> purely as a hoby.
From DB&rsquo;s I was mostly working with <abbr>MySQL</abbr>, <abbr>Postgres</abbr> or <abbr>MongoDB</abbr>. I also know how to code <abbr>HTML &amp; CSS</abbr> and I believe I will have no troubles learning anything I will need at Basecamp.</p>

		<p>Yes, I haven&rsquo;t been actively programing for quite some time. Yet I&rsquo;d like to get back to it and get better at this craft.</p>
		
		<p>Support programmer&rsquo;s job is nothing new to me as this was actually one side-role I had at Socialbakers. So I know how to explain technical things in a simple language and also I really like to help other people.</p>

		<p>Last but not least, since I saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDGHxO6N3Ms" target="_blank">episode of TWiST</a> with David many years ago you guys are my big inspiration. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more and I still nod my head in agreement with every essay in your Books.

		ÔøºÔøºÔøº
		<p>There is nothing that could motivate me more than to be able <strong>to work with you, constantly improve myself and Basecamp.</strong></p>
