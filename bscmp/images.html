		<h2>My thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			At first I would be trying to find out whether itâ€™s a broad issue or an individual one. <br>
			This is how I would be trying to analyze the issue and which root cause I would be suspecting in each case:   
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Several clients are experiencing the similar issue</strong> lately, then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I would be looking at the similarities of symptoms in all the reports.</li>
					<li>Also trying to replicate it in my own account and then estimate how many customers might be affected.</li>
					<li>Highly likely I assume that these things might have happened:
						<ul>
							<li>Something wenâ€™t wrong in the app, e.g. after recent update. I would look at the change-log, see what could cause it. If I would be sure I found the reason, I would try to revert this update at first (in case I truly believe there is nothing else that the revert could break) and contact the author in any case .</li>
							<li>Or it could be also issue specific to some internet provider, DNS or CDN (and in all or in just some locations).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>If itâ€™s an individual issue:</strong></p>
				<p>
					I would be looking at WHERE this issue occurred and HOW exactly it behaved:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>WHERE it happened:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>  <em>In just 1 browser on 1 PC.</em> I would recommend: <br> 1. Clearing cache and cookies / browsing history. <br>2. Trying to load Basecamp in the private browsing mode. <br>3. Turning off all extensions and <br> 4. Making sure that both JS (there would be notification in basecamp, I know, but still) and Image loading is turned on.</li>
							<li>  <em>In multiple browsers on 1 PC or on multiple devices.</em> <br>I would try to ping CDN url, try to check Internet connection / DNS, Firewall or Proxy settings.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>WHAT exactly was not loading:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>  <em>All images.</em> Chances that it will be resolved by the tips above are pretty high.</li>
							<li>  <em>All images, plus CSS/JS files as well.</em>   I would check availability of the CDN from this location. I would check DNS settings, internet connection and Proxy or Firewall as well.</li>
							<li>  <em>Specific images. E.g. thumbnails of some pictures only.</em> Then I would search for a bug in Basecamp, for example in the process of generating the thumbnail from an image. I would try to reproduce it by trying to generate thumbnail for the same file. And search in logs.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			There is a chance it could be something else than what I suspected above. More I try and more information I have should help me to discover where to be looking at.
		</p><p>	 
			Down bellow, there is also a draft of communication how I would proceed with a specific request.

						<p>Hi John,<br><br>

Sorry to hear that you have such troubles. Thank you very much for sending the screenshot. <br><br>

I can see that you are running Chrome on macOS and that pretty much all the images are not visible, while the rest of the content loaded well, including stylesheets. <br><br>

Letâ€™s try to locate what caused this. Could you please try to perform following steps and see if it helps?
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Opening your Basecamp in Incognito window (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464" target="_blank">here is how</a>). If it helped, it might be some extension causing this issue.</li>
							<li>Turn of all extensions (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769" target="_blank">here is how</a>) and then try to refresh Basecamp. If this helped, try to turn them on one by one until the problem returns. Then you should know which extension caused the troubles. I recommend to delete it afterwards.</li>
							<li>Try to clear cache and cookies/browsing data (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769" target="_blank">here is how</a>).</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							If neither of these steps helped, could you try to open Basecamp in some other browser (e.g. Safari) and see if the issue preserves?<br><br>

							In any case let please let me know how it worked.<br><br>

							Best regards,<br>

							Radek

		<h3>Internal follow up</h3>
		<p>Letâ€™s say this was Xth issue in the last 4 weeks caused by the same extension. Then I would suggest to try to proactively communicate it in troubleshooting guide. E.g. like on this <a href="https://basecamp.com/help/2/guides/troubleshooting/browser-troubles" target="_blank">page</a> for Basecamp 2.</p>
