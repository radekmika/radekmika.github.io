		<h2>My thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			  I guess that first I would be trying to find out whether it‚Äôs broad issue or individual one. This is how I would be trying to analyze the issue and which root cause I would be suspecting in each case:   
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>In case I would notice that <strong>several clients are experiencing similar issue</strong> lately, then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I would be trying to nail down the similar symptoms that should lead me to the point where it begun.</li>
					<li>Also trying to replicate it in my own account and estimate how many customers might be affected.</li>
					<li>Highly likely I assume that these things might have happened:
						<ul>
							<li>Something wen‚Äôt wrong in the app, e.g. after recent update. I would look at the change-log, see what could cause it. If I would be sure I found the reason, I would try to revert this update first (in case I truly believe there is nothing else that the revert could break) and in any case contact the author.</li>
							<li>Or it can be also issue specific to some internet provider, DNS or CDN (in all or just some locations).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>If it‚Äôs individual issue</strong>, I would be looking at WHERE this issue occurred and HOW exactly it behaved. I would be drilling down to find the root cause. Brief example of what I would be looking at:				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>WHERE it happened:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>  In just 1 browser on 1 PC.   I would recommend: 1. clearing cache and cookies / browsing history. 2. trying to load Basecamp in private browsing mode 3. turning off all extensions and 4. making sure that both JS (there would be notification in basecamp, I know, but still) and Image loading is turned on.</li>
							<li>  In multiple browsers on 1 PC or On multiple devices.   I would try to ping CDN url, try to check Internet connection / DNS settings. Dig in Firewall settings, if there is any.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>WHAT exactly was not loading:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>  All images.   Chances that it will be resolved by the tips above are pretty high.</li>
							<li>  All images and CSS/JS files as well.   I would check availability of the AKAMAI CDN from this location. I would check DNS settings and internet connection. And Firewall as well.</li>
							<li>  Specific images.   E.g. some thumbnails, then I would search for in-app bug, for example when generating thumbnail from an image. I would try to reproduce it by trying to generate thumbnail for the same file.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			  
			There is a chance it could be something else then what I suspect. But still, it‚Äôs more an example of discovery process. More I try and more information I have should help me to know where to be looking at.
			If it‚Äôs not going to lead me to the root cause I suspected, then still it‚Äôs going to help me find it as I it should lead me in the direction where I should be looking for. <br>
			Here is also a draft of communication how I would proceed with a specific request.

					<div>Hi John,<br><br>

Sorry to hear that you have such troubles. Thank you very much for sending the screenshot. <br><br>

I can see that you are running Chrome on macOS and that pretty much all the images are not visible, while the rest of the content loaded well, including stylesheets. <br><br>

Let‚Äôs try to locate what caused this. Could you please try to perform following steps and see if it helps?<br><ol>
	
<li>Opening your Basecamp in Incognito window (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464" target="_blank">here is how</a>). If it helped, it might be some extension causing this issue.</li>
<li>Turn of all extensions (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769" target="_blank">here is how</a>) and then try to refresh Basecamp. If this helped, try to turn them on 1 by 1 to until the problem returns, so you know which extension caused the troubles. I recommend to delete it afterwards.</li>
<li>Try to clearing cache and cookies/browsing data (<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2664769" target="_blank">here is how</a>).</li></ol><br>

If neither of these steps helped, could you try to open Basecamp in some other browser (e.g. Safari) and see, if the issue preserves?<br><br>

In any case let please let me know how it worked.<br><br>

Best regards,<br>

Radek

		<h3>Internal follow up</h3>
		<p>Let‚Äôs say this was Xth issue in the last 4 weeks caused by the same extension. Then I would suggest to try to proactively communicate it in troubleshooting guide. E.g. like on this <a href="https://basecamp.com/help/2/guides/troubleshooting/browser-troubles" target="_blank">page</a> for Basecamp 2.</p>
