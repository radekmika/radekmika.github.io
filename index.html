        Hi!<br /> I&rsquo;m Radek Mika, <a href="http://twitter.com/radekmika" target="_blank">@radekmika
        on Twitter</a>. I took a downtime since Dec 2016 to figure out what&rsquo;s next after almost 6 years of working for <a href="http://socialbakers.com/" target="_blank">Socialbakers</a>. <strike>I&rsquo;ve been working for <a href="http://socialbakers.com/" target="_blank">Socialbakers</a>, currently as a Director of Data Platform, since 2011.</strike>
      </p>
      <p>
        I went through several roles in the company (Developer, Scrum Master, Product Owner) and I was used to wearing more hats at the time. And before joining Socialbakers I was a freelance web apps developer.

            I still pretty much like to code whenever possible (letâ€™s call myself as hobyist). Besides that I am interested in Data Analysis, Agile and Lean.

        <p>I know a lot about Social Networks and their API's. Trust me, over the past few years I actually submitted over 120 bugs to Facebook. Aha! No more wondering why I didn't get the invite for <a href="https://www.fbf8.com/" target="_blank">#F8</a> this year! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

        I believe that key to success is doing what you love & having freedom doing that.
        While I am not busy at work I enjoy:
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling. Especially driving accross Europe.</li>
          <li>Squeezing out any sounds from electric quitar. #LesPaulRocks</li>
          <li>Playing with LEGO (hey, I am colector, right ;-)).</li>
          <li>Gaining new inspiration by reading books and listening to music.</li>
        </ul>
        I post pictures on <a href="https://instagram.com/radekmika" target="_blank">Instagram</a> & <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/31510603@N03/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.<br />
        And I love coffee. A lot.
