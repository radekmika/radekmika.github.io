        Hi!<br /> I&rsquo;m Radek Mika, <a href="http://twitter.com/radekmika" target="_blank">@radekmika
        on Twitter</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working for <a href="http://socialbakers.com/">Socialbakers</a>, currently as a Product Owner,
        since 2011.

        <p>
        I went trought a several roles in the company. Before joining bakers I was a freelance web apps developer. 
        I still know how to code and I do like it, but I wouldn't dare to call myself a developer anymore.
        Besides that I am interested in Data Analysis, Agile and Lean.

        <p>I know a lot about Social Networks and their API's. Trust me, over the past few years I actually submitted over 120 bugs to Facebook. Aha! No more wondering why I didn't get the invite for <a href="https://www.fbf8.com/" target="_blank">#F8</a> this year!</p>

        In September 2014 <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/radekmika/agile-at-socialbakers" target="_blank">I spoke at
        the Agile Prague conference </a> on Agile & Development at Socialbakers.
        A year after I refered to this topic in a blog article <a href="http://developers.socialbakers.com/2015/10/13/development-at-socialbakers/" target="_blank">"Development @ Socialbakers"</a>.

        I believe that key to success is doing what you love & having freedom doing that.
        While I am not busy at work I enjoy:
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling. Especially driving my #BMW through Europe.</li>
          <li>Squeezing out any sounds from electric quitar. #LesPaulRocks</li>
          <li>Playing with LEGO (hey, I am colector, right ;-)).</li>
          <li>Taking new inspiration by reading and listening to music.</li>
        </ul>
        I post pictures on <a href="https://instagram.com/radekmika" target="_blank">Instagram</a> & <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/31510603@N03/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.<br />
        And I love coffee. A lot.
